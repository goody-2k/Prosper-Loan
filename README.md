# Prosper-Loan
Prosper is a lending company that facilitates loans. It allows borrowers to request loans for various purposes. The goal of this study is to explore the employment status that is most prevalent among borrowers and determine the percentage of borrowers who own homes.

# DATASET
The Prosper loan dataset consists of 113,937 loan records, each featuring 81 attributes, including details like loan amount, borrower rate (interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and others. These entries span the years 2009 to 2014. The dataset is categorized into two main groups:

1: Borrower Information: This includes fundamental attributes of borrowers, such as annual income, employment status, interest rate, loan status, and more.

2: Loan Performance Information: This category involves metrics that assess the risk associated with loans, such as Prosper score and bank card utilization, among others. Some elements within the dataset require correction to ensure the creation of compelling and reliable analyses and visualizations.

# Summary of Findings
During the exploration, I discovered that the majority of borrowers were employed individuals, who exhibited the highest number of loan requests. Full-time workers ranked second on the list, while retired individuals had the lowest number of borrowers and also majority of the borrowers were house owners 

Furthermore, I expanded my inquiry to determine which year and month recorded the highest number of loan creations. The period from 2006 to 2008 exhibited a consistently upward trend, but in 2009, it experienced a decline before initiating a new trend in 2010. The peak occurred in 2013, followed by a significant drop in 2014. And January emerged as the month with the highest loan creation, while April recorded the lowest loan creation.
